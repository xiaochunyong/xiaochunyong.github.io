## backup/restore/uninstall 3个操作做了什么? 经常混淆
## Backup
> home/realfile  copy to backup/file and generate home/linkfile
```
Backup the application config files.

        Algorithm:
            if exists home/file
              if home/file is a real file
                if exists mackup/file
                  are you sure ?
                  if sure
                    rm mackup/file
                    mv home/file mackup/file
                    link mackup/file home/file
                else
                  mv home/file mackup/file
                  link mackup/file home/file
```



## Restore
> mackup/file generate linkfile to replace home/file
```
Restore the application config files.

        Algorithm:
            if exists mackup/file
              if exists home/file
                are you sure ?
                if sure
                  rm home/file
                  link mackup/file home/file
              else
                link mackup/file home/file
```

## Uninstall
> mackup/file  back to home/realfile
```
Uninstall Mackup.

        Restore any file where it was before the 1st Mackup backup.

        Algorithm:
            for each file in config
                if mackup/file exists
                    if home/file exists
                        delete home/file
                    copy mackup/file home/file
            delete the mackup folder
            print how to delete mackup
```
